## Oracle Machine Learning for R (OML4R)

Oracle Machine Learning for R (OML4R) enables you to use R (a statistical programming language) for statistical analysis, machine learning, and graphical analysis on data stored in an Oracle database. This allows you to benefit from the simplicity of R and power of the Oracle database without any need to deal with the complexities of sourcing, moving,and securing data.

In this workshop, you will use a dataset representing 15k customers of an insurance company. Each customer has about 30 attributes, and the goal is to train the model to predict a given customer's life-time value (LTV), and to classify them in predefined classes (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) based on this predicted customer life-time value. 

Note: In marketing, the life-time value (LTV) of a customer is an estimate of the net profit attributable to a given customer relationship over its lifetime.

**Estimated Lab Time:** 2 hours 50 min

**Objectives**
In this lab, you will:
* Establish connection from RStudio to Oracle database to prepare and explore data.
* Use Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) for Algorithm Selection, Feature Selection, Model Selection, and Model Tuning
* Use a CLASSIFICATION model for LTV_BIN assignment
* Use REGRESSION for estimating customer life-time value (LTV)


**Prerequisites**
* Oracle Database 21c installed on-premise (or in a VM in Cloud);
* R, RStudio, and required libraries
