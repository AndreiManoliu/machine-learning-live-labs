# Introduction to OML Services

The REST API for Oracle Machine Learning Services provides REST API endpoints hosted on Oracle Autonomous Database. These endpoints allow you to store Machine Learning models along with its metadata, and create scoring endpoints for the model. The REST API for Oracle Machine Learning Services supports both Oracle Machine Learning models and ONNX format models.


Estimated Time: 1 hour

### Objectives
•	Load data into Autonomous Database
•	Prepare the customer insurance date
•	Use AutoML to create a Machine Learning model.
•	Use Postman to score the machine learning model using REST APIs  
•	Use Curl to score the machine-learning model using REST APIs in command line.


### Prerequisites
* Prior knowledge and familiarity of Machine Learning Algorithms
