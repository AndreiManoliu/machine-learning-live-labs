# Loading an OML  model and score it using Rest Services

In this section of the workshop we will import the Decision Tree model used on the OML4PY workshop Step 3 in our Autonomous Database and score it using REST APIs

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives
We are going to run the next steps:
* Extract the saved model to a file;
* Load the model in the Autonomous Database repository;
* Deploy the model;
* Score a customer using the Decision Tree model;


### Prerequisites
* Run the OML4PY workshop. (Optional)
* Autonomous Database created
* OML user created in Autonomous database
* ``DTModel.mod`` on the VM

##Import the Decision Tree model

Task 1 can be performed only if OML4PY workshop was ran on the same VM prior the OML-Services workshop, otherwise you can **skip to Task 2**.

## Task 1: Extract the saved model to a file

* Connect to the VM and open a Terminal window.

  ![VM-Terminal](images/model-import-01.jpg)

* Run these commands one by one:

````
. setEnv

. oraenv

ORACLE_SID = [mlcdb] ? - Hit Enter
````

  ![VM-Terminal](images/model-import-02.jpg)

* Go to the OML_Services folder.

````
$<copy> cd ~/OML-Services</copy>
````

  ![VM-Terminal](images/model-import-03.jpg)


* Run the `prepare_model_import.sql` script to write the exported DT_MODEL to a file on the operating system.

````
$ <copy> sqlplus sys/MLlearnPTS#21_@localhost:1521/mlpdb1.sub07141037280.rehevcn.oraclevcn.com as sysdba @prepare_model_import.sql</copy>
````

The script runs the following steps.

  ![VM-Terminal](images/model-import-04.jpg)

  - Creates the **`dmuser`** OS folder
  - Creates the **`DMDIR`** database directory
  - Creates a procedure that writes a BLOB to a file
  - Writes the saved Decision Tree model to a file named **`DTModel.mod`**

  Now we have the model saved in a file, the next steps are to load the model in Autonomous Database, deploy it there and score a customer.

To check the exported file run the command:

````
$<copy>ls ~/dmuser</copy>
````

## Task: 2: Load the model in the Autonomous Database repository

*  In the Postman session opened run the following Get method to get the list of models deployed.

````
Operation: GET

URI endpoint:
<copy>https://adb.<region-prefix>.oraclecloud.com/omlmod/v1/models</copy>

````
 - Replace **`<region-prefix>`** with your region. In our case: _eu-frankfurt-1_.

 In the Authorization tab pick **Bearer Token** and paste the token copied from *Scoring OML using Rest Services Task 1*.

 ![Model Import](images/model-import-06.jpg)

The response is just the **SVMG** model we used in our previous tasks.

  ![Model Import](images/model-import-07.jpg)

In case you get the Expired Token Error, rerun the generate Token command explained in **Scoring OML using Rest Services: Task 1**.

* Open a new tab in Postman and run the following POST command to load the model in Autonomous Database.

````
Operation: POST

URI endpoint:
<copy>https://adb.<region-prefix>.oraclecloud.com/omlmod/v1/models </copy>

````
 - Replace **`<region-prefix>`** with your region. In our case: _eu-frankfurt-1_.

 In the Authorization tab pick **Bearer Token** and the token is pre-filled.

 ![Model Import](images/model-import-08.jpg)

In the Headers tab enter the following:

````
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
boundary: Boundary
````

  ![Model Import](images/model-import-09.jpg)


In the Body tab pick form-data and enter `modelData` in the key field, hover over the right side of the field and pick File in the dropdown.

  ![Model Import](images/model-import-10.jpg)

Click Select File; go to `/home/oracle/OML-Services/` folder and select the **`DTModel.mod`** file created earlier.

  ![Model Import](images/model-import-11.jpg)

Add the next keys in the Body tab and click Send.

````
 modelName=DTModel
 modelType=OML
 version=1.0
````
  ![Model Import](images/model-import-12.jpg)

The response is that the model is created.

 ![Model Import](images/model-import-13.jpg)

Copy the **`modelId`** displayed in the JSON response.


## Task: 3: Deploy the model

* Open a new tab in Postman and run the following POST command to deploy the model in Autonomous Database.

````
Operation: POST

URI endpoint:
<copy>https://adb.<region-prefix>.oraclecloud.com/omlmod/v1/deployment </copy>

````
  - Replace **`<region-prefix>`** with your region. In our case: _eu-frankfurt-1_.

In the Authorization tab pick **Bearer Token** and the token is pre-filled.

  ![Model Deploy](images/model-import-14.jpg)  

In the Headers tab enter the following:

````
Content-Type: application/json
````

  ![Model Deploy](images/model-import-15.jpg)

 In the Body tab enter the following JSON:

````
 {
   "uri":"dtmodel",
   "modelId":"50ffc903-aaf6-4a94-a228-4cb7ab6b3c07"
}
````

Where `50ffc903-aaf6-4a94-a228-4cb7ab6b3c07` is the model Id copied from the previous step. Replace it with the returned model Id from your command in Task 6.2.

The URI **`dtmodel`** we are going to use in the Task 6.4 when scoring the data against our model.

And the result is:

 ![Model Deploy](images/model-import-17.jpg)

The next step is to score a customer.


## Task: 4: Score a customer using the Decision Tree model

In this step we are going to score Fran Hobbs against our Decision Tree imported model.

Enter the following details:

````
Operation: POST

URI endpoint:
<copy>https://adb.<region-prefix>.oraclecloud.com/omlmod/v1/deployment/<model_URI>/score </copy>

````
 - Replace **`<region-prefix>`** with your region. In our case: _eu-frankfurt-1_.

 - Replace **`<model_URI>`** with the model URI that we defined in previous task: **`dtmodel`**

In the Authorization tab pick **Bearer Token** and the token is pre-filled.

 ![Model Score](images/model-import-18.jpg)  


In the header Tab enter the details:

````
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'

````

  ![Model Score](images/model-import-19.jpg)  


In the Body tab enter the Fran Hobs data in RAW format. Notice that we are not providing any of the ``LTV`` or ``LTV_BIN`` data, but provide fully the other important data

````

{
   "inputRecords":[
      {
         "CUST_ID":"CU12350",
         "LAST":"FRAN",

         "PROFESSION":"Programmer/Developer",
         "BUY_INSURANCE":"No",
         "AGE":21,
         "HAS_CHILDREN":0,
         "SALARY":66180,
         "N_OF_DEPENDENTS":5,
         "CAR_OWNERSHIP":1,
         "HOUSE_OWNERSHIP":0,
         "TIME_AS_CUSTOMER":5,
         "MARITAL_STATUS":"SINGLE",

         "T_AMOUNT_AUTOM_PAYMENTS":197,
         "MONTHLY_CHECKS_WRITTEN":4,
         "MORTGAGE_AMOUNT":0,
         "N_TRANS_ATM":3,
         "N_MORTGAGES":0,
         "N_TRANS_TELLER":2,
         "CREDIT_CARD_LIMITS":2500,
         "N_TRANS_KIOSK":4,
         "N_TRANS_WEB_BANK":0
      }
   ]
}
</copy>

Click Send

  ![Model Score](images/model-import-20.jpg)  

Notice the response for this scoring.

  ![Model Score](images/model-import-21.jpg)  

In this case the percentages are different but it still has the highest probability to be in the **LOW** category as it was in our Support Vector Machine Gaussian model.
